        <p>The pleasant Village of Moweaqua, Illinois, is located in the center of the state, along US 51, straddling the Christian/Shelby County Line, just south of the Macon County Line. Moweaqua is a growing and welcoming community of 2,000 friendly people with the traditional work ethic of midwestern small towns. The Village is surrounded by some of the absolute best farmland in the U.S., producing very high yields of corn and soybeans. The high land values and robust farm economy form a strong, stable economic base for the Village.</p>
        <p>The Village of Moweaqua was established in 1852 by Mr. Michael Schneider. Depending on which Native American translation you choose, the name means either “muddy water” or “weeping woman”.</p>
        <p>Moweaqua suffered a disastrous coal mine explosion on Christmas Eve, 1932, which is documented in detail here. A small museum has informational displays studied by visiting historians.</p>
        <p>Modern Moweaqua is, today, a prosperous farming community and retail trading center offering convenient local supplies of groceries, hardware, restaurants with home cooking, pizza, a bowling alley, cabinetry, automotive repair, an auction house, jewelry and gifts, antiques, second-hand shops, and more. You will enjoy being called by name when you visit Moweaqua businesses.</p>
        <p>Community activities serving a wide scope of interests take place in the excellent Central A&amp;M school facilities and the three Village parks. North Park is home to many soccer, baseball, and volleyball games. The park features tennis courts, basketball courts, playground equipment, and a 1-mile walking trail. The 4th of July celebration, with entertainment and fireworks, is held at North Park.</p>
        <p>Memorial Tree Park has 92 species of native Illinois trees, shading extensive plantings of native grasses and flowers, an idyllic setting for a delightful stroll. Central Park is the setting for the Pow-Wow Days celebration in June. Moweaqua also offers a popular 18-hole golf course in a quiet rural setting.</p>
        <p>Moweaqua is truly the “One And Only.”</p>
